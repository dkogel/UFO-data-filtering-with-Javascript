# javascript-challenge
The purpose of this challenge was to practice working with Javascript and using D3.js
as an event listener. Using a sample dataset of UFO sightings in the form of a JSON, I created a website with a table of sightings that can be filtered by any or all columns based on user input from a form. 

#### To try out the website, please use the link below

*Note: please use filter criteria you see in the dataset, as it's a fairly small set. Otherwise, your're likely to filter out all of the data and simply get an empyt table*
