# UFO data filtering with Javascript
The purpose of this challenge was to practice working with Javascript and using D3.js
as an event listener. Using a sample dataset of UFO sightings in the form of a JSON, I created a website with a table of sightings that can be filtered by any or all columns based on user input from a form.

#### To try out the website, please use the link below and us the form to filter the table

*Note: please enter filter criteria you can see displayed in the table, as it's a fairly small dataset. Failing to do so won't create any errors, but you're likely to filter out all of the data and simply get an empty table*
